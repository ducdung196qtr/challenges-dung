Challenge:

Build a landing page demo animation effect bellow.

Describe:

This animation effect creates a dynamic, modern interaction where images react to mouse movement. As the cursor hovers, multiple images smoothly follow its position in real-time, combined with continuous transitions between visuals (e.g., changing opacity, scaling, or swapping images) to generate a sparkling “bling” effect.

The result is a visually captivating experience that draws user attention. Built with JavaScript for tracking cursor coordinates and CSS transforms/transitions (or GSAP for advanced animations), the effect enhances UI engagement by blending fluid motion, layered elements, and seamless image updates, making the interface feel alive and interactive.

Keywords: Cursor tracking, fluid transitions, layered visuals, sparkling effect, dynamic UI.
